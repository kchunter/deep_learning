Goal: Given an image, classify as taken "during the day" (0) or "during the night" (1).

1. Data?
Labeled images captured during the day and during the night (outdoor and indoor or only outdoor? are there images that were taken in sunrise or sunset?;
depending on these things the problem will be more or less complex)

2. Number of images?
You want to try to gauge the complexity of the task. So, let's say, we did a problem that was cat recognition. Detect if there is a cat on an image or not.
In this problem, we remember that with 10 000 images we managed to train a pretty good classifier. How do you compare this problem to the cat problem? Is it easier
or harder? It's easier. So in terms of complexity, this task looks less complex than the cat recognition task, so you would probably need less data.
That's a rule of thumb. 

3. Train/Test split?
Around 80/20%. The bigger the dataset the more I would put in the train set.

4. Bias?
You need a correct balance between classes. Ideally, 50:50%.

5. Resolution?
As small as possible to achieve a good result (computational cost). How to get this number? Compare to human performance. Lets humans to classify images on
different resolutions. Select the smallest one on which humans've got a perfect performanse.

6. Cost function?
This is a binary classification problem so you'll use binary cross-entropy as your cost function.
